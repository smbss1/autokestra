# v0.1 Release Gate

This is the minimum set of checks to run before tagging v0.1.

## Local

From the repo root:

- `bun run lint`
- `bun run test`

## Optional: build artifacts

- `bun run build`

### CLI standalone executable

- `cd packages/cli`
- `bun run build:exe`

This produces `packages/cli/dist/autokestra` (OS/arch-specific).

## Runtime budget

CI runs `bun run test` on `ubuntu-latest`. Keep new integration-style tests lightweight:
- prefer in-process `createApp().fetch(...)` over binding network ports
- prefer temp SQLite files over external services
- avoid Docker in CI unless explicitly gated/optional
